    "## Notation\n",
    "- **N**: number of `QueryVectors` API calls.\n",
    "- **K**: `topK` per call (1–30).\n",
    "- **C**: vector comparisons per call (internal compute S3 Vectors charges for).\n",
    "- **P**: price per 1,000,000 comparisons (assume $1.00 for planning).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost (USD)** = (N × C / 1,000,000) × P\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rules of thumb for C:\n",
    "- For K in [10, 30], a good planning range is **C ≈ 300–500** comparisons/call.\n",
    "- A simple linear model that works well: **C ≈ 15 × K** (midpoint).\n",
    "-  Three-anchor gold suite, two calls each (N=6), K=20 → midpoint ≈ 6 × 0.000015 × 20 = $0.0018; band ≈ $0.0018–$0.0030.\n",
    "- One evaluation pass of 40–50 tests, one call each (N∈{40,50}), K=20 → midpoint ≈ $0.012–$0.015.\n",
    "- Development total of 1,000–2,000 calls over two months, K=30 → midpoint ≈ $0.45–$0.90; sensitivity band ≈ $0.30–$1.00. (That is N×450/1e6×$1 vs N×[300,500]/1e6×$1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- Think in terms of how many candidate vectors S3 Vectors (or any ANN service) **must inspect per query** to find the top-K most similar ones.\n",
    "- Each query inspects not just the final K results but **a larger candidate set C** (the number of actual dot-product or cosine comparisons performed). C depends on how broad the search space is.\n",
    "- Filtered: A few dozen to a few hundred sentences. 300-400?\n",
    "- Open: Whole index, all filings, Hundreds of thousands of sentences. 500-open?\n",
    "- Hence, we give them different slopes for C. not fixed constants, just planning heuristics.\n",
    "- Open query: evaluate global recall: can the system still find relevant sentences across filings, years, or companies?\n",
    "- **Why does midpoint**: we don’t know the exact number of comparisons per query—S3 doesn’t expose that metric—you plan around a midpoint estimate.\n",
    "- literature-based boundaries: HNSW, FAISS, and similar ANN indexes typically use 300–500 internal comparisons for topK≈10–30.\n",
    "- we choose a midpoint constant (≈15×K) as a convenient linear approximation.\n",
    "- **sensitivity band**: safety range, you don’t know the exact number of internal vector comparisons, depends on: pruning heuristics, query distribution, etc.\n",
    "- “Even if the service internally does as few as 300 or as many as 500 comparisons per query, my total cost will still land within this range.”\n",
    "- ` Cost_low  = (N_total * 300) / 1e6 * P , Cost_high = (N_total * 500) / 1e6 * P `\n",
    "- band gives you context: “this cost might fluctuate by 20–30% either way depending on runtime search intensity.”\n",
