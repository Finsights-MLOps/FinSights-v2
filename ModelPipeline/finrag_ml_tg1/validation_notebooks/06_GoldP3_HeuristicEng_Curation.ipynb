    "### Gold Test P3: Business Realism Design Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas:\n",
    "- Pick 5 issuers with different industries (e.g., auto, fintech, semiconductor, retail, pharma) and one target year (say 2020).\n",
    "  - (a) export the right slice of data for 5 companies in 1 year and \n",
    "  - (b) use that slice to curate a 30-question global gold (P3).\n",
    "  - **Problem**: diff year comparisons need multi-year data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test questions would mirror actual analyst workflows:\n",
    "- Temporal queries: \"How did Microsoft's cloud revenue grow 2018→2020?\"\n",
    "- Comparative queries: \"Which had higher capex in 2019: Apple or Google?\"\n",
    "- Section-aware queries: \"What risks did Tesla highlight in 2020?\" (expects ITEM_1A hits)\n",
    "- KPI extraction: \"Amazon's operating cash flow in fiscal 2019?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Question Taxonomy: Extensive Ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "- A. Local factual (exact statement; single sentence evidence).\n",
    "    - Examples: “What was Company A’s revenue in 2020?” Answer: numeric + unit; Evidence: one MD&A line.\n",
    "- B. Local causal (“why/what drove”).\n",
    "    - Example: “Why did operating cash flow increase in 2020 for Company B?” Evidence: MD&A causal sentence.\n",
    "- C. Cross-section within year (global in structure, same year).\n",
    "    - Example: “What major supply chain risk did Company C highlight in 2020?” Evidence may live in ITEM_1A, not MD&A.\n",
    "- D. Cross-year within company (2019 vs 2020).\n",
    "    - Examples: “How did capex change from 2019 to 2020?” Answer requires two sentences; allow small numeric tolerance.\n",
    "- E. Cross-company compare (same year).\n",
    "    - Example: “Which of Company D or E reported higher gross margin in 2020?” Evidence: one sentence per company.\n",
    "- F. Aggregation/summarization light.\n",
    "    - Example: “List Company A’s top two stated 2020 growth drivers.” Evidence: two sentences; answer type multispan.\n",
    "- G. Verification/consistency.\n",
    "    - Example: “Does the MD&A explicitly state that FX drove revenue decline?” Yes/No with cite.    \n",
    "- H. Definition/label grounding.\n",
    "    - Example: “Where does Company A define ‘Adjusted EBITDA’?” Evidence: policy/definitions section; answer: quote span.\n",
    "- I. Temporal reference disambiguation.\n",
    "    - Example: “What period does ‘the year’ refer to in this filing?” Evidence: header/date sentence; answer: YYYY.\n",
    "- J. Negative control (no-answer).\n",
    "    - Example: “Does Company E disclose headcount in 2020?” Expected: “Not found” with empty evidence; validates abstention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process - Potential, 1:\n",
    "-  For each of the 5 companies, scan the KPI view and pick 2–3 canonical numeric statements (revenue, gross margin, cash from ops). That’s 10–15 easy local factuals.\n",
    "- From MD&A causal atlas, select 1–2 “why” statements per company (5–10 items).\n",
    "- From Risk atlas, pick 1 specific risk per company; phrase the question to target it (5 items).\n",
    "- Add 3–4 cross-company compares (gross margin, revenue, capex) and 2–3 cross-year trend questions for one or two issuers.\n",
    "- Add 2 negative controls and 2 verification/definition items.\n"
